# SortedList
In order to get the correct values to reach the money that the user gave, I have to sort two lists without using the method that already exists in Python.


After shuffling the list using the Python shuffle() method, I have to sort it in a decrescent order.
Creating new and sorted lists based on the original one, all is ready to begin.
It's created an infinite loop, this requires an input from the user with the amount of cash that he wants to know the combination of bills and coins to reach this amount.
But there is an issue, in some scenarios we may lose 1 cent (a penny), in order to correct this its necessary to use a round() method in the subtraction of the money less quantity times bill, now it's everything all right.
To finish this code, I ask the user if he wants to continue with another amount of money or not.
